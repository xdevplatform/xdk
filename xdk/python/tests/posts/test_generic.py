"""
Auto-generated generic tests for {"class_name": "Posts", "display_name": "posts", "import_name": "posts", "original": ["posts"], "property_name": "posts"} client.

This module contains general tests that validate the overall client
functionality, imports, error handling, and common behavior patterns
that apply across all operations without being operation-specific.

Generated automatically - do not edit manually.
